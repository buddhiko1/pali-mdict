He murdered his father to gain the throne, and conspired with Devadatta to kill the Buddha, but was later converted. He had a son Udāyibhadda. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#10.2'>DN.i.50</a></p><p>Ajātasattu was greatly impressed by Devadatta’s powers of <i>iddhi</i> and became his devoted follower. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17/en/brahmali#2.1.7'>Vin.ii.185</a> He built for him a monastery at Gayāsīsa and waited upon him morning and evening carrying food for him, sometimes as much as five hundred cartloads in five hundred cooking pans. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn17.36/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.ii.242</a></p><p>Devadatta incited him to seize the throne, killing his father if necessary. When Bimbisāra learnt of the prince’s intentions he abdicated in his favour. But Devadatta was not satisfied till Bimbisāra, who was one of the Buddha’s foremost supporters, was killed.</p><p>Ajātasattu helped Devadatta in several of the latter’s attempts to kill the Buddha.</p><p>Later he was filled with remorse for these past misdeeds as he confesses himself; <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#98.1'>DN.i.85</a> but evidently, for very shame, he refrained from visiting the Buddha till he was won over by the persuasions of his physician Jīvaka Komārabhacca. And when in the end he did go to the Buddha, it was in great fear and trembling; so nervous was he that he imagined conspirators in the very silence surrounding the Buddha where he dwelt in the monastery, in Jīvaka’s Mango grove at Rājagaha. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#7.1'>DN.i.49–50</a></p><p>It was on the occasion of this visit that the Sāmaññaphala Sutta was preached. The king admits that he had been to various teachers before, but had failed to find satisfaction in their teachings. It is noteworthy that the Buddha greets the king cordially on his arrival and makes no mention whatever of the king’s impiety. Instead, when Ajātasattu expresses his repentance at the end of the discourse, the Buddha accepts his confession and lets him off almost too lightly. But after the king had departed the Buddha tells the monks how the king’s misdeeds had wrought his undoing both in this world and the next, for if he had not been guilty of them, the Eye of Truth would have been opened for him on the occasion of this sermon. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#98.1'>DN.i.85–86</a></p><p>Henceforth the king became a loyal adherent of the Buddha’s faith, though, as far as we know, he never waited again either upon the Buddha or upon any member of the Order for the discussion of ethical matters. He was so full of love and respect for the Buddha that when he heard of Upaka Maṇḍikāputta having spoken rather impolitely to the Buddha, he at once flew into a rage. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.188/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.ii.182</a></p><p>Bimbisāra had married a sister of Pasenadi, and when he was killed she died of grief.</p><p>The revenue of a Kāsī village had been given to her by her father, Mahākosala, as part of her dowry, but after Bimbisāra’s murder, Pasenadi refused to continue it. Thereupon Ajātasattu declared war on his uncle. Before this, uncle and nephew seem to have been on very friendly terms. Once Ajātasattu sent Pasenadi a wonderful piece of foreign fabric, sixteen cubits long and eight broad, mounted on a pole to serve as a canopy. This Pasenadi gave to Ānanda. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn88/en/sujato#15.4'>MN.ii.116</a></p><p>At first he was victorious in three battles, but, later, he was defeated by Pasenadi, who followed the military advice of an old monk, the Elder Dhanuggahatissa; Ajātasattu was taken captive with his army. On giving an undertaking not to resort to violence again, he was released, and to seal the friendship, Pasenadi gave him his daughter Vajirā as wife, and the revenue of the disputed village was gifted to her as bath-money. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.13/en/sujato#4.1'>SN.i.82–85</a></p><p>Later, when through the treachery of Pasenadi’s minister, Dīgha Kārāyana, his son Viḍūḍabha usurped the throne, Pasenadi, finding himself deserted, went towards Rājagaha to seek Ajātasattu’s help, but on the way he died of exposure and Ajātasattu gave him burial.</p><p>About a year before the Buddha’s death, Ajātasattu sent his chief minister and confidant, the brahmin Vassakāra, to the Buddha to intimate to him his desire to make war on the Vajjians and to find out what prediction the Buddha would make regarding his chances of victory. The Buddha informed the brahmin that the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of welfare which they had learnt from him, and that they were therefore invincible. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.1.1'>DN.ii.72<em>f.</em></a> The Saṁyutta Nikāya mentions the Buddha as saying that the time would come when the Vajjians would relinquish their strenuous mode of living and that then would come Ajātasattu’s chance. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn20.8/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.ii.268</a></p><p>Rumours are mentioned of King Candappajjota making preparations for a war on Ajātasattu to avenge the death of his friend Bimbisāra, but no mention is made of actual fighting. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn107/en/sujato#16.1'>MN.iii.7</a></p><p>It was he who built the fortress of Pāṭāliputta, which later became the capital of Māgadha.</p></dd></dl>"

He bought the park at great expense and erected therein the famous Jetavanārāma. As a result of this and of his numerous other benefactions in the cause of the Sāsana, Anāthapiṇḍika came to be recognised as the chief of alms-givers. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an1.221/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.i.25</a></p><p>Anāthapiṇḍika’s personal name was Sudatta, but he was always called Anāthapiṇḍika (feeder of the destitute) because of his munificence; he was, however, very pleased when the Buddha addressed him by his own name. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd16/en/brahmali#4.3.3'>Vin.ii.156</a> He spent eighteen crores on the purchase of Jetavana and a like sum on the construction of the <i>vihāra</i>; another eighteen crores were spent in the festival of dedication.

He was the son of the Sākyan Amitodana and brother of Mahānāma. When members of other Sākyan families had joined the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mahānāma was grieved that none had gone forth from his own. He therefore suggested to his brother that one of them should leave household life. Anuruddha was at first reluctant to agree, for he had been reared most delicately and luxuriously, dwelling in a different house for each season, surrounded by dancers and mimes. But on hearing from Mahānāma of the endless round of household cares he agreed to go. He could not, however, get his mother’s consent until he persuaded his cousin Bhaddiya to go with him. Together they went with Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta and their barber Upāli, to the Blessed One at the Anupiya Mango Grove and were ordained. Before the rainy season was over Anuruddha acquired the divine eye. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17/en/brahmali#1.1.1'>Vin.ii.180–183</a> He was later ranked foremost among those who had obtained this attainment. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an1.175-186/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.i.23</a></p><p>He then received from Sāriputta, as topic of meditation, the eight thoughts of a great man. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.29/en/sujato#14.1'>AN.iv.228<em>ff.</em></a> Another conversation he had with Sāriputta before becoming an arahant is reported. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.128/en/sujato#6.1'>AN.i.281–282</a> He went into the Pācīnavaṁsadāya in the Ceti country to practise these. He mastered seven, but could not learn the eighth. The Buddha, being aware of this, visited him and taught it to him. Thereupon Anuruddha developed insight and realised arahantship in the highest grade. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.29/en/sujato#14.1'>AN.iv.228<em>ff.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag16.9/en/sujato#10.1'>Thag.901</a></p><p>When the Buddha, disgusted with the quarrels of the Kosambī monks, went away to seek more congenial surroundings, it was to Pācīnavaṁsadāya that he repaired, where were Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila. The Upakkilesa Sutta, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn128/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.iii.153<em>f.</em></a> on the sweets of concord and freedom from blemish, seems to have been preached specially to Anuruddha on that occasion, for we are told at the end that he was pleased to have heard it, no mention being made of the other two. And again in the Naḷakapāna Sutta, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn67/en/sujato#19.1'>MN.i.462<em>ff.</em></a> though a large number of distinguished monks are present, it is to Anuruddha that the Buddha directly addresses his questions, and it is Anuruddha who answers on behalf of them all. See also the Cūḷa—and the Mahā-Gosiṅga Suttas.</p><p>Anuruddha was present when the Buddha died at Kusinārā, and knew the exact moment of his death; the verse he uttered on that occasion is thoughtful and shows philosophic calm, in contrast, for example, with that of Ānanda. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.7.1'>DN.ii.156–157</a></p><p>Anuruddha was foremost in consoling the monks and admonishing them as to their future course of action. It was Anuruddha again that the Mallas of Kusinārā consulted regarding the Buddha’s last obsequies. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.14.1'>DN.ii.160<em>f.</em></a></p><p>In one of the verses ascribed to Anuruddha in the Theragāthā <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag16.9/en/sujato#13.1'>Thag.904</a> it is said that for twenty-five years he did not sleep at all, and that for the last thirty years of his life he slept only during the last watch of the night.</p><p>The Anuruddha Saṁyutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn52.1/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.v.294</a> gives an account of a series of questions asked by Moggallāna on the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>, their extent, etc. Anuruddha evidently laid great emphasis on the cultivation of the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>, for we find mention of them occurring over and over again in his discourses. He attributes all his powers to their development, and admonishes his hearers to practise them. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn52.4/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.v.299–306</a> He himself considered the divine eye as the highest attainment. Thus in the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn32/en/sujato#4.1'>MN.i.213</a> he declares it to be more worthy than knowledge of the doctrine, meditation, forest-life, discourse on the abhidhamma or self-mastery.</p><p>Once he lay grievously ill in the Andhavana in Sāvatthī, but the pain made no impression on his mind, because, he says, his mind was well grounded in the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn52.9/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.v.302</a> Apart from his teaching of the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>, he does not seem to have found fame as a teacher. He was of a retiring disposition and never interfered in any of the monks’ quarrels.</p><p>Mention is often made of Anuruddha’s <i>iddhi</i>-powers. Thus, he was one of those who went to the Brahma-world to curb the pride of the Brahma who had thought that no ascetic could reach his world. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn6.5/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.i.145</a> (The others being Moggallāna, Mahākassapa and Mahākappina.) The mother of the Yakkha Piyaṅkara, while wandering in search of food, heard him at night reciting some verses from the Dhammapada and stood spellbound listening. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn10.5/en/sujato#4.1'>SN.i.209</a></p><p>His <i>iddhi</i>, however, does not seem to have enabled him to prevent his fellow-dweller Abhiñjika from talking too much, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn16.5/en/sujato#4.1'>SN.ii.203–204</a> nor his other fellow-dweller Bāhiya from attempting to create dissension in the Order. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.242/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.ii.239</a> Among the Vajjians he seems to have been held particularly in esteem, together with Nandiya and Kimbila.

At the end of two months, finding that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency he could possibly supply. Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he approached Ānanda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha’s permission, the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the monks.

The deputation of the Saṅgha went to Kīṭāgiri and made an order that the Assaji-Punabbasukā should no longer dwell there, but the latter, instead of obeying the injunction, abused the monks, accusing them of partiality, and not only departed from Kīṭāgiri, but also left the Order.

It is true, however, that even on this occasion when the Buddha sent for them, they came dutifully and listened patiently to his admonition on the necessity of implicit obedience to a teacher in whom they had faith, and we are told that they were “even gladdened in their hearts” after hearing the Buddha.

Several incidents connected with him are mentioned in the Vinaya. Once he promised to spend the rainy season with Pasenadi Kosala, but on his way there he saw two lodgings where robes were plentiful and so kept Vassa in those lodgings instead. Pasenadi was greatly annoyed and when, in due course, the matter reached the ears of the Buddha, Upananda was rebuked and a set of rules was passed regarding promises made about the rainy season. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd3/en/brahmali#12.9.1'>Vin.i.153</a> On another occasion Upananda spent the rainy season at Sāvatthī, but when the time came for the monks to gather together and divide the robes that had been given to them, he went from village to village, taking his share of the robes from everywhere. The Buddha sent for him and rebuked him in the presence of the Order, but the rebuke had evidently no effect, for we find him again spending the Vassa alone in two residences, with the idea of obtaining many robes. The Buddha, however, ordered that only one portion should be given to him. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#24.6.3'>Vin.i.300</a> His greediness was not confined to robes. Once he was invited to a meal by an official, a follower of the Ājīvakas. He went late, and finding no room left for him, made a junior monk get up and give him his seat. There was a great uproar, but Upananda had his way. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd16/en/brahmali#9.2.24'>Vin.ii.165</a> Elsewhere he is accused of having appropriated two lodgings for himself at the same time, one at Sāvatthī and the other somewhere in the country. He was evidently unpopular among the monks, because on this occasion we find him spoken of as “a maker of strife, quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal questions.”. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd16/en/brahmali#12.1.1'>Vin.ii.168</a> Upananda was fond of money, for we find in the Vinaya <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/brahmali#1.4.12'>Vin.ii.297</a> a statement to the effect that “on the occasion of the matter of Upananda the Sākyan, the Buddha distinctly laid down a precept by which gold and silver were forbidden.” Upananda had been given his meals regularly by a certain</p><p>family. Once a dish of meat was prepared for him, but a little boy in the house started to cry for the meat, and it was given to him. Upananda insisted that a kahāpaṇa should be paid to him in lieu of the meat. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np17/en/brahmali#2.7'>Vin.iii.236<em>f.</em></a> Upananda was once asked to preach to those that came to Jetavana. Among the visitors was a banker, and when the banker expressed the desire to give something to Upananda to show his appreciation of the sermon, Upananda wished to have the robe that the man wore. The banker was embarrassed, and promised to go home at once and fetch him another robe, even better than the one he had on. But Upananda was adamant, till, in despair, the man gave him his robe and went away. Again, when Upananda heard that a certain man wished to offer him a robe, he went to the man and told him what kind of robe he wanted, and said he would accept no other. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np7/en/brahmali#2.1.15'>Vin.iii.215</a> A story is also told of a Paribbājaka exchanging his own garment for one belonging to Upananda, which was of rich colour. Two other Paribbājakas told him that he had lost in the bargain, so he wished to cry off the deal, but Upananda positively refused. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np19/en/brahmali#2.13'>Vin.iii.240<em>f.</em></a> He did not, however, always come off best in a bargain. Once he gave a robe to a colleague, on condition that the latter should join him in his tours. The condition was agreed to, but later, when the recipient monk heard that the Buddha was going on tour, he preferred to join the Buddha’s company. The robe was not returned to Upananda, who had to be reported to the Buddha for the violent language he used to the defaulter. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np24/en/brahmali#2.28'>Vin.iii.254<em>f.</em></a> Upananda is mentioned as quarrelling with the Chabbaggiyā monks <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8/en/brahmali#2.5.18'>Vin.iv.30</a> and, at another time, as going his alms-rounds with a colleague with whom he quarrelled when the rounds were over, refusing to give him any of the food obtained.

We are told that once a complaint was made to the Buddha that Upananda had gone to the house of an acquaintance and had sat down in the bedroom of the woman of the house, talking to her. The husband ordered food to be brought to Upananda, and when that was done, asked him to leave. But the woman wished him to stay and he refused to go away. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc42/en/brahmali#2.2.4'>Vin.iv.94</a></p><p>On two other occasions he is mentioned as visiting the houses of his acquaintances and being found by the husbands, seated alone with their wives. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc43/en/brahmali#1.15'>Vin.iv.95–97</a></p><p>With most laymen, however, be was evidently popular.

The Buddha, by his magical powers, overcame, first this Nāga and then another, both of whom vomited fire and smoke. Kassapa being pleased with this exhibition of <i>iddhi</i>-power, undertook to provide the Buddha with his daily food. Meanwhile the Buddha stayed in a grove near by, waiting for the time when Kassapa should be ready for conversion. Here he was visited by the Four Regent Gods, Sakka, Brahma and others. The Buddha spent the whole rainy season there, performing, in all, three thousand five hundred miracles of various kinds, reading the thoughts of Kassapa, splitting firewood for the ascetics’ sacrifices, heating stoves for them to use after bathing in the cold weather, etc. Still Kassapa pesagested in the thought, “The great ascetic is of great magic power, but he is not an arahant like me.” Finally the Buddha decided to startle him by declaring that he was not an arahant, neither did the way he followed lead to arahantship. Thereupon Kassapa owned defeat and reverently asked for ordination. The Buddha asked him to consult with his pupils, and they cut off their hair and threw it with their sacrificial utensils into the river and were all ordained. Nadī-Kassapa and Gayā-Kassapa came to inquire what had happened, and they, too, were ordained with their pupils.

Even at this time, however, the memory of Kāsi as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men’s minds. It is very frequently mentioned as such in the Jātakas and elsewhere. Kāsi was once ruled by the Bhāratas, one of whom, Dhataraṭṭha, was its king in the time of Reṇu. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#35.4'>DN.ii.235<em>f.</em></a> There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kāsi and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other. In one such war, Dīghāti the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of Kāsi, but Dīghīti’s son Dīghāvu won back the kingdom. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd9/en/brahmali#7.20.108'>Vin.i.334</a></p><p>The traditional name of the king of Kāsi from time immemorial was evidently Brahmadatta, and references to kings of that name abound in the Jātakas.

Kāsigāma or Kāsinigama was probably the actual name of the village in Kāsi which was given by Mahākosala to his daughter when she married Bimbisāra. The village produced a revenue of one hundred thousand, and was given to the queen for her bath and perfume money. After Bimbisāra’s death, Pasenadi withdrew the gift from Ajātasattu, which act was the cause of a war between the two. Later, when Pasenadi’s daughter Vajirā was married to Ajātasattu, the village was given back as part of her dowry. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.13/en/sujato#4.1'>SN.i.82<em>ff.</em></a></p></dd><dd class='info'><span class='location'>25.32913, 82.41394</span><span class='precision'>1</span><span class='type'>janapada</span></dd></dl>"

Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find Ānanda mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha’s Parinibbāna.<a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.16.16'>DN.ii.146</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#1.1.1'>DN.ii.169</a> It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to Kosala and Māgadha from the south and the west. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#1.24.6'>Vin.i.277</a></p><p>The usual route from Rājagaha to Kosambī was up the river.

The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.</p><p>A great division once arose among the monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks’ behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakaloṇakāragāma and the Pācīnavaṁsadāya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthī, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd10/en/brahmali#1.1.1'>Vin.i.337–357</a> The story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in the Udāna <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ud4.5/en/sujato'>Ud.4.5</a> and in the Saṁyutta, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.80/en/sujato#9.1'>SN.iii.94</a> but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.</p><p>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/brahmali#1.5.3'>Vin.ii.298</a></p><p>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/brahmali#2.8.62'>Vin.ii.307</a></p><p>Kosambī is mentioned in the Saṁyutta Nikāya <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.240/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.iv.179</a> as being on the Ganges, but here as elsewhere this simply means on a great river, in this case the Yamuna.</p></dd><dd class='info'><span class='location'>25.338984,81.392899</span><span class='precision'>1</span><span class='type'>town</span></dd></dl>"

It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists - the others being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Kusināra - because it was at, the Migadāya in Isipatana near Bārānasī that the Buddha preached his first sermon to the Pañcavaggiyā <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.8.1'>DN.ii.141</a>. This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law (Dhamma-cakka). It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues <span class='ref'>MN-a.i.388</span>; <span class='ref'>Bu-a.242</span>, etc., but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the Ajīvaka Upaka.</p><p>Benares was an important centre of trade and industry. There was direct trade between there and Sāvatthi (Dhp-a.iii.429), the road passing through Bhaddiya <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd5/en/brahmali#6.4.9'>Vin.i.189</a>, and between there and Takkasilā <span class='ref'>Dhp-a.i.123</span>. It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasilā E.g., <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja151/pli/ms#2.1'>Ja.ii.4</a>; <span class='ref'>Dhp-a.i.250</span>, but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasilā (<span class='ref'>Kh-a.198</span>; see also <span class='ref'>Dhp-a.iii.445</span>, where Susīma, Sankha's son, goes from Takkasilā to Benares for purposes of study).</p><p>From Verañjā to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, crossing the Ganges at Payāgatittha. From Benares the road continued to Vesāli <span class='ref'>Sp.i.201</span>. On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#23.13.11'>Vin.i.220</a>. There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#1.19.8'>Vin.i.275</a>. The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river <span class='ref'>MN-a.ii.929</span>.</p><p>The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated E.g., <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.377</span>; <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.160</span>; <span class='ref'>MN-a.ii.608</span> to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Samyama. (The SNA. on the Khaggavisāna Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas).</p><p>The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārānasī is attributed to Mahāgovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#35.4'>DN.ii.235</a>. The Ceylon Chronicles <span class='ref'>MT. 127,129,130</span> mention the names of others who reigned in Benares - e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.119<em>f</em></span>; and in that of the Sankha, Molinī <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.15</span>. It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura E.g., <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja514/pli/ms#34.1'>Ja.v.54</a>; <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja543/pli/ms#7.1'>Ja.vi.165</a>; <span class='ref'>Dhp-a.i.87</span>, being the capital of Kāsi. The Bhojājāniya Jātaka <span class='ref'>Ja.i.178</span> says that 'all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares.' In the Brahāchatta Jātaka <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.116</span>, the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Bārānasīggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja282/pli/ms#3.1'>Ja.ii.403</a>.</p><p>Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kos.</p></dd><dd class='info'><span class='location'>25.2993376,83.0044556</span><span class='precision'>1</span><span class='type'>town</span></dd></dl>"

It is said that when the Buddha was in need of anything he would go to Ghaṭīkāra’s house and take it, whether he were at home or not, so great was his confidence in Ghaṭīkāra’s piety. Once, when Ghaṭīkāra was absent, the people, at the Buddha’s suggestion, took away the thatch from his house to roof the hut of Tathāgata. For three months Ghaṭīkāra’s house remained open to the sky, but no rain fell on it, so great was his faith.</p><p>The Bodhisatta, who at the time of Ghaṭīkāra was a young brahmin named Jotipāla, was the friend of Ghaṭīkāra but had no faith in the Buddha, and Ghaṭīkāra, having failed to persuade him to visit the Buddha, in the end took him by force. Jotipāla was converted and joined the Order, but Ghaṭīkāra, as the only support of his parents, could not renounce the world.

He then resumed his own form, and Ajātasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and sent him daily five hundred dishes of food.</p><p>Sometime later, Devadatta went to the Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to him in view of the Buddha’s approaching old age. The Buddha scorned the suggestion, saying, “Not even to Sāriputta or Moggallāna would I hand over the Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17/en/brahmali#2.5.9'>Vin.ii.188</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn58/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.i.393</a> Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance. Thereupon, at the Buddha’s suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Saṅgha that in anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha, none but Devadatta was to be recognised.</p><p>It was at this time that Devadatta incited Ajātasattu to kill his father, Bimbisāra, while he himself prepared to kill the Buddha. Ajātasattu agreed, and provided Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha. These were placed on different paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale. But when the Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha’s majesty, and his body became stiff. The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing away his weapons, confessed his intended crime. The Buddha thereupon preached to him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path. The other groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after the other. The different groups were led to the Buddha by his <i>iddhi</i>-power, and he preached to them and converted them. The first man returned to Devadatta saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great <i>iddhi</i>-power.</p><p>Devadatta then decided to kill the Buddha himself. One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhakūṭa, he hurled down on him a great rock. Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha’s foot, causing the blood to flow. Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from there to Jīvaka’s Ambavana, where Jīvaka attended him. After this event, the monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was impossible for anyone to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.</p><p>Devadatta’s next attempt on the Buddha’s life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalāgiri (or Dhanapāla), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass. The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back. As the elephant advanced he pervaded it with love, and thus completely subdued it.</p><p>This outrage made Devadatta very unpopular, and even Ajātasattu was compelled by the force of public opinion to withdraw his patronage from Devadatta, whose gain and honour decreased. Thereupon he decided, with the help of several others, Kokālika, Katamoraka-tissa, Khaṇḍadeviyāputta and Samuddadatta, to bring about a schism in the Order. These five went accordingly to the Buddha and asked for the imposition of five rules on all members of the Saṅgha.</p><ol><li>that monks should dwell all their lives in the forest, </li><li>that they should accept no invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging, </li><li>that they should wear only robes made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, </li><li>that they should dwell at the foot of a tree and not under a roof, </li><li> that they should abstain completely from fish and flesh. </li></ol><p>The Buddha’s reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules—except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season—but he refused to make the rules obligatory. This refusal delighted Devadatta, who went about with his party, declaring that the Buddha was prone to luxury and abundance. He was believed by the foolish, and in spite of the Buddha’s warning against the dire sin of causing schism in the Order, Devadatta informed Ānanda of his intention of holding an uposatha meeting without the Buddha, and, having persuaded five hundred newly ordained monks from Vesāli to join him, he went out to Gayāsīsa. Three suttas, the two Devadatta, and the Mahāsāropama, were preached after this event.</p><p>The Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to Gayāsīsa to bring back the deluded ones. Devadatta, believing that they had come to join him, rejoiced, and, in spite of Kokālika’s warning, welcomed them. That night he preached very late to the monks, and, wishing for rest, asked Sāriputta to address the assembly. Sāriputta and Moggallāna preached to such effect that they persuaded the five hundred monks to return with them. Kokālika kicked Devadatta on the chest to awaken him and tell him the news. When Devadatta discovered what had happened, hot blood came from his mouth, and for nine months he lay grievously ill.</p><p>As his end drew near, he wished to see the Buddha, though the latter had declared that it would not be possible in this life. Devadatta, however, started the journey on a litter, but on reaching Jetavana, he stopped the litter on the banks of the pond and stepped out to wash. The earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avīci.</p><p>Only once is mention made <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an9.25/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iv.402<em>f.</em></a> of the text of a sermon by Devadatta. Candikāputta reports this to Sāriputta, who makes it an occasion for a talk to the monks.</p></dd></dl>"

By expelling through penance all past misdeeds and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future became cleared. From the destruction of deeds results the destruction of dukkha; this leads to the destruction of vedanā. Thus all dukkha is exhausted and one passes beyond the round of existence. It is said that Nāṭaputta did not employ the term kamma in his teaching; he used, instead, the word daṇḍa; and that, according to him, the daṇḍa of deed was far more criminal than the dandas of word and mind. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn55/en/sujato#11.1'>MN.i.371</a></p><p>He is said to have shown no hesitation in declaring the destinies of his disciples after death <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn44.9/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iv.398</a> ; but Sakuludāyi says <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn79/en/sujato#4.1'>MN.ii.31</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#15.1'>MN.i.93</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn101/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.ii.214<em>f.</em></a> that when asked a question as to the past, he skipped from one matter to another and dismissed the question, evincing irritation, bad temper and resentment.</p><p>Only one discussion is recorded between Nāṭaputta and a follower of the Buddha, and that was with Citta gahapati at Macchika Sanda. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn41.8/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iv.298<em>ff.</em></a> He praises Citta at the outset of the discussion, holding him up as an example to his own flock, and agreeing with Citta that knowledge is more excellent than faith. But later, when Citta claims knowledge of the four <i>jhānas</i>, Nāṭaputta is represented as condemning him for a deceitful man. Citta, thereupon, asks him ten questions and, getting no answer, leaves him.</p><p>The Devadaha Sutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn101/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.ii.214</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.i.91<em>ff.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.78/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.v.150</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato#4.1'>DN.iii.119</a> contains a detailed analysis and attributed to the Buddha, of the beliefs and teachings of the Nigaṇṭhas. He there selects for his condemnation ten of their operative utterances, major and minor, and proves that the efforts and strivings of the Nigaṇṭhas are fruitless.</p><p>The books contain the names of several disciples of Nāṭaputta, among them a deva called Ninka. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.30/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.66</a> Nāṭaputta is so convinced of the truth and the irrefutableness of his own doctrines, that he actually encourages his disciples to hold discussions with the Buddha. Some, like Dīgha Tapassī, come away unscathed, without having carried the discussion to any conclusion; others are mentioned as being convinced by the Buddha in the end and as becoming his disciples. Such, for instance, are Asibandhakaputta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn42.7/en/sujato#4.1'>SN.iv.317<em>ff.</em></a> and Abhayarājakumāra. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn57/en/sujato#15.1'>MN.i.392<em>ff.</em></a> Nāṭaputta tries, without success, to dissuade Sīha, general of the Licchavis, from visiting the Buddha. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.12/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.iv.180<em>ff.</em></a> Sīha goes and is converted. The next day he holds an almsgiving, on a grand scale, to the Buddha and his monks, at which flesh is served.

Nāṭaputta had allowed Upāli to visit him in spite of the warning of Dīgha-Tapassī as to the Buddha’s arresting personality. But Nāṭaputta thought Upāli would be proof against it, and, on hearing that he had renounced his allegiance to the Nigaṇṭhas, refused to believe it until he could verify the information himself. The discovery of the apostasy of Upāli prostrated him with grief.; he vomited hot blood and had to be carried away on a litter from Bālaka, where he was then living, to Pāvā. There, soon after, he died, and immediately great dissensions arose among his followers.

Their presence seems to have been recognized and respected from earlier times. Generally speaking, their creed is formulated as a belief in perfect bliss after death for the self purged from evil, and as a conviction that this bliss can be won by brahmacariyā, by freedom from all evil in acts, words, aims, and mode of livelihood. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn78/en/sujato#4.1'>MN.ii.24</a></p><p>All these four standards of conduct were bodily incorporated in the Buddha’s Noble Eightfold Path, and the last of the four gave to the Ājīvakas their specific name as a separate sect. The Paribbājakas claimed to be identical with the followers of the Buddha in their tenets and teaching, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn11/en/sujato#2.1'>MN.i.64f</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn13/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.i.84<em>f.</em></a> but the Buddha maintained that the two teachings were quite distinct. This is clearly indicated <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#22.16.1'>Vin.i.39</a> in connection with the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who were Paribbājakas under Sañjaya. The goal of the Paribbājakas was deathlessness which, to them, probably meant birth in the world of Brahmā. Their conversion to the Buddha’s Doctrine followed the recognition that Gotama dealt, not with effects but with causes, and that he went to the root of the matter by teaching how casual states of consciousness arose and how they could be banished for ever. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.42/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iv.35<em>ff.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an9.11/en/sujato#14.1'>AN.iv.378</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.70/en/sujato#35.1'>AN.i.215</a></p><p>The Paribbājakas were not ascetics except in so far as they were celibates; some of them were women. They were teachers or sophists who spent eight or nine months of every year wandering from place to place for the purpose of engaging in friendly, conversational discussions on matters of ethics and philosophy, nature lore and mysticism. They differed very much in intelligence, earnestness, and even in honesty. Some of the views discussed in the Brahmajāla Sutta, for instance, and described as those of “Eel wrigglers” and “Hair splitters”, were undoubtedly truly thus described. The books mention halls erected for the accommodation of the Paribbājakas, such as those in Mallikā’s park at Sāvatthī, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn9/en/sujato#1.1'>DN.i.178</a> and the Kūṭāgārasālā at Vesāli.</p><p>Sometimes special places were set apart for them in the groves near the settlements, as at Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā lake, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato#1.1'>DN.i.111</a> at the Moranivāpa in Rājagaha, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an11.9/en/sujato#7.1'>AN.v.326</a> and on the banks of the Sappinikā. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.63/en/sujato#12.1'>AN.i.185</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.184/en/sujato#7.1'>AN.ii.175</a></p><p>It was in such places that the Paribbājakas met each other, and in the course of their journeys they would visit each other in order to exchange greetings of courtesy and to engage in profitable discussion. The utmost cordiality seems to have prevailed on these occasions, intercourse and discussions were free, there were no restrictions of creed, caste or pride. Thus Dīghanakha calls on the Buddha, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn73/en/sujato#27.1'>MN.i.497</a> the Buddha on Sakuladāyī <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn78/en/sujato#14.1'>MN.ii.29</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.184/en/sujato#7.1'>AN.ii.175<em>ff.</em></a> and Sarabha. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.63/en/sujato#12.1'>AN.i.185</a> Vekhanassa calls on the Buddha, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn80/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.ii.40</a> as do Timbaruka, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.17/en/sujato#9.1'>SN.ii.22</a> Vacchagotta, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn32.56/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iii.257</a> and Sivaka Moliya. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn36.21/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iv.230</a> Potaliputta calls on Samiddhi, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn136/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.iii.207</a> Susīma on Ānanda, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.69/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.ii.119</a> and Jambukhādaka on Sāriputta. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn37.34/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.iv.251</a></p><p>The inhabitants of the towns and villager, near which the Paribbājakas stopped, visited them, both to show their respect and to benefit by their teachings.

On remembering, he made ample amends, gave Pilinda five hundred attendants to look after the monastery, and granted for their maintenance a village, which came to be called Arāmikagāma or Pilindagāma. One day, while in the village for alms, Pilinda went into a house where a girl was weeping because the day was a feast day and she had no ornament to wear, her parents being too poor to afford any. Pilinda gave her a roll of grass to put round her head and it turned instantly into solid gold. The king’s officers, hearing of this wreath, suspected the family of theft and cast them into prison. The next day Pilinda, discovering what had happened, visited the king and convinced him of his <i>iddhi</i> powers by turning the whole palace into gold. The family was released, and the king and his courtiers gave to Pilinda large quantities of the five medicaments, all of which Pilinda distributed among those who wished for them. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#14.5.12'>Vin.i.206<em>ff.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np22/en/brahmali#2.2.45'>Vin.iii.248<em>ff.</em></a> This was the occasion for the forming of the rule that all medicaments required by a monk should be used within seven days.</p><p>Another story is related of Pilinda’s <i>iddhi</i> powers. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#7.46.13'>Vin.iii.67</a> Once a family of Benares, which was wont to minister to Pilinda, was attacked by robbers and two girls were kidnapped.

The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in Pāvā and Kusinārā. The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyakā Mallā, those of Kusināra, Kosinārakā. That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha’s death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha’s relics. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.24.5'>DN.ii.165</a> Each had their Mote Hall.</p><p>In the Saṅgīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of Cunda the smith. A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night. It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.11.1'>DN.ii.126<em>f.</em></a> From there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent Ānanda to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death. The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects. Ānanda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family. After the Buddha’s death, they met together once more in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a Cakkavatti. They cremated the Buddha’s body at the Makuṭabandhana cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Doṇa. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.25.1'>DN.ii.166</a> The Mallas, both of Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.27.1'>DN.ii.167</a></p><p>The Malla capital of Kusinārā was, in the Buddha’s day, a place of small importance. Ānanda contemptuously refers to it as a “little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township,” quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha’s Parinibbāna. But the Buddha informs Ānanda that it was once Kusāvatī, the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahāsudassana. They were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#12.1'>MN.i.231</a> The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.</p><p>Both the Buddha and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas. Pāvā was the scene of Nāṭaputta’s death, just as Kusinārā was of the Buddha’s. Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name—e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khaṇḍasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Rojā and Sīha.</p><p>Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed—e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiya and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide tract of forest.</p></dd><dd class='info'><span class='location'>26.739416,83.890041</span><span class='precision'>1</span><span class='type'>janapada</span></dd></dl>"

Mahā Kassapa then arrived and walked three times round the pyre with bared shoulder, and it is said the Buddha’s feet became visible from out of the pyre in order that he might worship them.

He was probably not popular among certain nuns, for, at the end of his discourse, Thullatissā openly reviled him for what she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ānanda, “as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker.”. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn16.10/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.ii.215<em>f.</em></a> Kassapa was very careful of the good name of the Order, and we find him <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn16.11/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.ii.218<em>f.</em></a> blaming Ānanda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to the criticism of the public. “A corn trampler art thou, Ānanda,” he says, “a despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting away,” and ends up with “The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure.” Ānanda, annoyed at being called “boy,” protests “Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence.” Ānanda regarded Kassapa in some sort of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even his name, lest it should imply disrespect. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#73.1.1'>Vin.i.92<em>f.</em></a></p><p>Thullanandā heard Kassapa censuring Ānanda and raised her voice in protest, “What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can chide the learned sage Ānanda?” Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to Ānanda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the Buddha for special honour.</p><p>Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn16.13/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.ii.224<em>f.</em></a> At the First Council, when Ānanda stated that the Buddha had given leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and contempt from the laity. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/brahmali#1.7.28'>Vin.ii.287<em>f.</em></a></p><p>Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and energetic. See also the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn32/en/sujato#7.1'>MN.i.214</a> where Kassapa declares his belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to others is proved by the case of Somamitta who, finding his own teacher Vimala given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his guidance.</p><p>When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came after him, that they might attain to the same end. Even when he was old and the Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near him, he begged to be excused. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn16.4/en/sujato#4.1'>SN.ii.202<em>f.</em></a></p><p>Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at Pipphaliguhā, the Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven bojjhangas which he had practised. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn46.11/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.v.78</a></p><p>Kassapa had special compassion for the poor and would sgo to the poorest families to seek alms. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ud3.7/en/sujato'>Ud.3.7</a></p><p> Sāriputta seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and the Kassapa Saṁyutta contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibbāna, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn16.1/en/sujato#5.1'>SN.ii.195<em>f.</em></a> and the other on the existence of a Tathāgata after death. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn16.11/en/sujato#16.1'>SN.ii.222<em>f.</em></a> This regard was mutual, for when Kassapa saw the great honour paid to Sāriputta by the devas he rejoiced greatly and broke forth into song. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag18.1/en/sujato#32.1'>Thag.1082–1085</a></p></dd></dl>"

The Buddha preached to them, and ordained them by saying, ”Come, monks.” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#22.16.1'>Vin.i.39<em>ff.</em></a> Moggallāna went to the hamlet of Kallavāla <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.60/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iv.85<em>f.</em></a> in Māgadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness overcame him as he sat meditating. The Buddha knew this, and appearing before him, exhorted him to be zealous. That very day he attained arahantship.</p><p>Sāriputta and Moggallāna are declared to be the ideal disciples, whose example others should try to follow.<a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn17.21/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.ii.235</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an2.127/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.i.88</a> In the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn141/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.iii.248</a> the Buddha thus distinguishes these “twin brethren” from the others— “Sāriputta is as she who brings forth and Moggallāna is as the nurse of what is brought forth; Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good.” Moggallāna’s pre eminence lay in his possession of psychic power. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an1.175-186/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.i.23</a> He could create a living shape innumerable times and could transfer himself into any shape at will. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#44.1'>Thag.1183</a> When the Buddha and his monks failed to get alms in Verañja, Moggallāna offered to turn the earth upside down, so that the essence of the earth, which lay on the under surface, might serve as food. He also offered to open a way from Nalerupu, that the monks might easily go there for alms; but this offer was refused by the Buddha. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#2.1.14'>Vin.iii.7</a></p><p>Several instances are given of this special display of <i>iddhi</i>. Once, at the Buddha’s request, with his great toe he shook the Migāramātupāsāda, and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper story. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn51.13/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.v.269<em>ff.</em></a></p><p>On another occasion, when Moggallāna visited Sakka to find out if he had profited by the Buddha’s teaching, he found him far too proud and obsessed by the thought of his own splendour. He thereupon shook Sakka’s palace, Vejayanta, till Sakka’s hair stood on end with fright and his pride was humbled. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato#48.1'>MN.i.251<em>ff.</em></a> Again, Moggallāna is mentioned as visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance of Baka Brahmā. He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the Sudhamma-Hall in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views were erroneous. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#59.1'>Thag.1198</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn6.4/en/sujato#10.1'>SN.i.144<em>f.</em></a> Other visits of his to the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa Brahmā. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.32/en/sujato#3.1'>AN.iii.331<em>ff.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.56/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iv.75<em>ff.</em></a></p><p>In the Māratajjanīya Sutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.i.332<em>ff.</em></a> we are told how Māra worried Moggallāna by entering into his belly, but Moggallāna ordered him out and told him how he himself had once been a Māra named Dūsī whose sister Kāḷī was the mother of the present Māra. Dūsī incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.</p><p>Moggallāna could see petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn18.22/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.ii.254<em>ff.</em></a> We are told <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn55.17/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.v.366<em>f.</em></a> that Moggallāna’s visits to the deva worlds were very welcome to the devas.</p><p>The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggallāna’s powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the Sākyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggallāna, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary. And Moggallāna spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of them. At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iv.183<em>ff.</em></a> Mention is made elsewhere <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn39.1-15/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.iv.262–269</a> of eloquent sermons preached by him on the <i>jhānas</i>, on qualities which lead to true emancipation, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.83/en/sujato#3.1'>AN.v.155<em>ff.</em></a> and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach. Other devas also went to hear him—e.g., Candana, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn40.9/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iv.269–280</a> He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn44.6/en/sujato#6.1'>SN.iv.391<em>ff.</em></a> and Vappa, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.194/en/sujato#6.1'>AN.ii.196<em>ff.</em></a> eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure. There is one instance recorded of Moggallāna seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.19/en/sujato#18.1'>AN.iv.204<em>ff.</em></a> Once, when a monk charged Sāriputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggallāna and Ānanda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear Sāriputta vindicate himself. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd19/en/brahmali#1.1.1'>Vin.ii.236</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an9.11/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iv.374</a></p><p>Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahmā singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kokālika monk.<a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.89/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.v.170<em>ff.</em></a> <span class='ref'>Snp.p.231<em>ff.</em></span> When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gayāsīsa, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to bring them back. They were successful in this mission. Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggallāna and later born in a huge manomayakāya, had warned Moggallāna of Devadatta’s intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggallāna.<a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17/en/brahmali#2.1.7'>Vin.ii.185</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.99/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iii.122<em>ff.</em></a> Moggallāna seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks’ welfare. Among the verses attributed to him in the Theragāthā are several containing exhortations to his colleagues. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#1.1'>Thag.1146–1149</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#26.1'>Thag.1165<em>f.</em></a> Some of the colleagues are mentioned by name—e.g., Tissa, Vaḍḍhamāna and Potthila.<a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#23.1'>Thag.1162</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#24.1'>Thag.1163</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#35.1'>Thag.1174<em>f.</em></a> Elsewhere <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn8.9/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.194<em>f.</em></a> mention is made of his living at Kāḷasilā, with a company of five hundred monks, watching over them and discovering that all were arahants. Vaṅgīsa witnessed this and praised Moggallāna in verse before the Buddha.</p><p>The love existing between Moggallāna and Sāriputta was mutual, as was the admiration. Sāriputta’s verses in praise of Moggallāna <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#39.1'>Thag.1178–1181</a> are even more eloquent than those of Moggallāna in praise of Sāriputta. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato#37.1'>Thag.1176</a> Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn21.2/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.ii.275<em>ff.</em></a> Moggallāna elsewhere also <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn21.1/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.ii.273<em>f.</em></a> tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers.

Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and Anuruddha are again mentioned <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn47.24/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.v.174<em>f.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn52.4/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.v.299</a> as staying in the Ketakīvana in Sāketa. Among discussions between Anuruddha and Moggallāna is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of the value of cultivating the four <i>satipaṭṭhānas</i>. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn52.1/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.v.294<em>f.</em></a> It seems to have been usual for Sāriputta and Moggallāna, in their journeys, to travel together at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were anxious to include them in their invitations. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.37/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iii.336</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.52/en/sujato#12.1'>AN.iv.63</a></p><p>Sāriputta dies before Moggallāna.

By the time of Bimbisāra, Aṅga, too, formed a part of Māgadha, and he was known as king of Aṅga Māgadha. Thus Bimbisāra sends for Soṇa Koḷivisa, a prominent citizen of Campā, capital of Aṅga. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#17.2.6'>Vin.i.27</a> In the Buddha’s day, Māgadha consisted of eighty thousand villages. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd5/en/brahmali#1.1.1'>Vin.i.179</a></p><p>Ajātasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.2.1'>DN.ii.73<em>f.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.24.1'>DN.ii.86</a></p><p>At the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Māgadha was bounded on the east by the river Campā, on the south by the Vindhyā Mountains, on the west by the river Soṇa, and on the north by the Ganges. The latter river formed the boundary between Māgadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the Māgadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river.</p><p>During the early Buddhist period Māgadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning. The kings of Māgadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi marrying each other’s sisters. When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbisāra sent him his own personal physician, Jīvaka.</p><p>In Māgadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampati: <i>pātur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo</i> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#5.2.4'>Vin.i.5</a> ), and it was from Māgadha that it spread after the Third Council.

The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean “the world under the sway of death” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.29/en/sujato#14.1'>AN.iv.228</a> and the beings therein. Thence, the <i>kilesas</i> also came to be called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the <i>kilesas</i> were likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a <i>devaputta</i> of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.</p><p>Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the <i>kilesas</i>, and the world over which Death and the <i>kilesas</i> hold sway. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.113/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.iv.91</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.62/en/sujato#13.1'>SN.iii.73</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp8/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.8</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp40/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.40</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn5.10/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.135</a></p><p>The legend of Māra attacking the Buddha to prevent his Awakening had its origin in the Padhāna Sutta. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.5/en/sujato#11.1'>Snp verse 494–517</a> There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjara, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to Māra’s army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others. “Seeing this army on all sides,” says the Buddha, “I go forth to meet Māra with his equipage. He shall not make me yield ground. That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.” Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.</p><p>The second part of the Padhāna Sutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.2/en/sujato#22.1'>Snp verse 446<em>f.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn4.23/en/sujato#9.1'>SN.i.122</a> is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama. After Māra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, “like a crow attacking a rock,” he left Gotama in disgust. “The lute of Māra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence.”</p><p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn4.24/en/sujato#8.1'>SN.i.124<em>f.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.25/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.v.46</a> also contains a sutta in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment. Their names are Taṇhā, Arati and Ragā, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra’s army, as given in the Padhāna Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.</p><p>Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans. Thus the books mention various occasions on which Māra appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.</p><p>Soon after the Buddha’s first vassa, Māra approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by Māra’s fetters. But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#12.2.1'>Vin.i.22</a> On another occasion Māra entered into the body of Vetambarī and made him utter heretical doctrines. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.30/en/sujato#11.1'>SN.i.67</a> In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.i.326</a> Māra is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants of the Brahma world. The Māra Saṁyutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn4.1/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.103<em>ff.</em></a> contains several instances of Māra’s temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhakūṭa fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his hearers. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#1.1'>DN.iii.58</a> In the account of Godhika’s suicide <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn4.23/en/sujato#9.1'>SN.i.122</a> there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, Māra went about looking for his consciousness, and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, “going about like a cloud of smoke.”</p><p>The books mention many occasions on which Māra assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunīs, often in lonely spots—e.g., Āḷavikā, Kisāgotamī, Somā, Vijayā, Uppalavantnā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā and Khemā.</p><p>Mention is made, especially in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, of several occasions on which Māra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelā, soon after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sāsana was firmly established.</p><p>With the accounts of Māra, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual <i>devaputta</i>, named Māra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmitā Vasavatti deva world. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya, Māra is described as the head of those enjoying bliss in the Kāmāvacara worlds. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.14/en/sujato#4.1'>AN.ii.17</a> In the Māratajjanīya Sutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#6.1'>MN.i.333</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato#28.28'>DN.iii.79</a> Moggallāna says that he too had once been a Māra, Dūsī by name; Kālā was his sister’s name, and the Māra of the present age was his nephew. In the sutta, Dūsī is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Māra of Gotama’s day. According to the sutta, Māradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men.</p></dd></dl>"

Nāgas).</p><p>Elsewhere <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.36/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.ii.38</a> they rank, in progressive order, between <i>manussā</i> and <i>gandhabbā</i>. They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks. In the early records, <i>yakkha</i>, like <i>nāga</i>, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative. Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#3.1'>MN.i.252</a> but even the Buddha is spoken of as a <i>yakkha</i> in poetic diction. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato#28.1'>MN.i.386</a> Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.17/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.i.54</a> Of these above named, the followers of Vessavaṇa appear to be the Yakkhas proper. The term <i>yakkha</i> as applied to <i>purisa</i> is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning “soul” in such passages as ettāvatā yakkhassa suddhi, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.4/en/sujato#30.1'>Snp verse 478</a> or <i>ettāvat’ aggam no vadanti h’ ekā, yakkhassa suddhim idha paṇḍitāse</i>. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp4.11/en/sujato#14.1'>Snp verse 875</a></p><p>The cult of <i>yakkhas</i> seems to have arisen primarily from the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants. To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vimānas found in or near the sea or in lakes. Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva’s supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful. They are sometimes called <i>devatā</i> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn9.14/en/sujato#5.1'>SN.i.205</a> or <i>devaputta</i>. Some of these, like Indakūta and Sūciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics. All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will.</p><p>Sometimes the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres. The female Yakkhas (Yakkhinī) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male. They eat flesh and blood and devour even men. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn23/en/sujato#23.47'>DN.ii.346</a></p><p>Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence. They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii. In the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#1.1'>DN.iii.194<em>f.</em></a> however, the Yakkha king, Vessavaṇa, is represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the Yakkhas. Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in their woodland haunts. Cp. the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill Sāriputta. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ud4.4/en/sujato'>Ud.4.4</a> But the Mahā Yakkhas, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#9.1'>DN.iii.204<em>f.</em></a> the generals and commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent wicked Yakkhas from hurting them. Among Yakkhas are some beings who are <i>sotāpannas</i>—e.g., Janavasabha, Sūciloma and Khara. The case of the Yakkha Vajirapāṇi is of special interest. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.20.6'>DN.i.95</a> He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the air, threatening to kill Ambaṭṭha, if he does not answer the Buddha’s question the third time he is asked. In many cases the Yakkhas are “fallen angels” and come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to a higher sphere of existence e.g., Piyaṅkaramātā and Punabbasumātā, and even Vessavaṇa, listening to Veḷukaṇḍakī Nandamātā reciting the Parāyana Vagga. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.52/en/sujato#12.1'>AN.iv.63</a> At the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta many hundreds of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.</p><p>The names of the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function. These are taken from (a) their bodily appearance e.g., Kuvannā, Khara, Kharaloma, Kharadāthika, Citta, Cittarāja, Silesaloma, Sūciloma and Hāritā; (b) their place of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc. e.g., Ajakalāpaka, Āḷavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), Kumbhīra, Gumbiya, Disāmukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, Vajirapāṇi or Vajirabāhu, Sātāgira, Serīsaka; (c) qualities of character, etc. e.g., Adhamma, Katattha, Dhamma, Puṇṇaka, Māra, Sakaṭa; (d) embodiments of former persons e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= Bimbisāra), Dīgha, Naradeva, Paṇḍaka, Sīvaka, Serī.</p><p>Vessavaṇa is often mentioned as king of the Yakkhas. He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#6.11'>DN.iii.199<em>ff.</em></a> contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly halls. Vessavaṇa is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and messengers. They wait upon him in turn.</p><p>No one, apparently, is free from this necessity of waiting upon the king even Janavasabba has to run errands for Vessavaṇa. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#10.11'>DN.ii.207</a> The Yakkhas hold regular assemblies. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#7.36'>DN.iii.201</a></p><p>It is sometimes difficult to decide whether the Yakkhas were non-humans spirits or aboriginal tribespeople. In the Vinaya, intercourse with <i>yakkhas</i> is forbidden. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#10.13.2'>Vin.iii.37</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6/en/brahmali#2.1.11'>Vin.iv.20</a></p></dd></dl>"

Impelled by antecedent conditions, he saw one night the indecorum of his sleeping attendants, and, greatly distressed, put on his gold slippers and left the house and the town, non humans opening the gates for him. He took the direction of Isipatana, exclaiming— “Alas! What distress! Alas! What danger!” The Buddha saw him in the distance and called to him, “Come Yasa, here is neither distress nor danger.” Filled with joy, Yasa took off his slippers and sat beside the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a graduated discourse, and when he had finished teaching the Truths, Yasa attained realization of the Dhamma. To Yasa’s father, too, who had come in search of his son, the Buddha preached the Doctrine, having first made Yasa invisible to him. At the end of the sermon he acknowledged himself the Buddha’s follower, and Yasa, who had been listening, became an arahant. When, therefore, Yasa’s presence became known to his father, who asked him to return to his grieving mother, the Buddha declared that household life had no attractions for Yasa and granted his request to be admitted to the Order. The next day, at the invitation of Yasa’s father, he went, accompanied by Yasa, to his house, and there, at the conclusion of the meal, he preached to Yasa’s mother and other members of the household, who all became his followers, thus becoming the first tevācikā upāsikā. When Yasa’s intimate friends, Vimala, Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, heard of Yasa’s ordination they followed his example and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course, as did fifty others of Yasa’s former friends and acquaintances. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#7.1.1'>Vin.i.15–20</a></p><p>A verse attributed to him in the Theragāthā says that he attained the Three Knowledges even while still adorned with fine clothes. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag1.117/en/sujato#1.1'>Thag.117</a></p></dd><dt><dfn id='Yasa2'>Yasa</dfn><sup>2</sup></dt><dt>Kākandakaputta</dt><dd><p>A monk who lived about a century after the Buddha, and who was one of the leaders in the events of the Second Council. When he arrived at the Kūṭāgārasālā in the Mahāvana, he discovered that the Vajjian monks had raised the “Ten Points” contrary to the Buddha’s teachings, and that they were publicly asking for money from their lay disciples. Yasa thereupon protested against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, offered him a share of the money they had collected.</p><p>This offer he rejected with scorn, and the monks passed on him the <i>Patisārattiyakamma</i> (craving of pardon from lay folk). This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having misinformed them. But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha’s discourses to prove his charge.</p><p>When the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the <i>Ukkhepaniyakamma</i> (Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared through the air to Kosambī, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, of the west (Pātheyyakā or Pāveyyakā) and of the south (Dakkhiṇāpatha), asking for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion. With them he visited Sambhūta Sānavāsī at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult Revata who lived in Soreyya. Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him through Saṅkassa, Kaṇṇakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahajāti. Having found Revata, he questioned him regarding the ten points, and obtained from him promise of assistance.</p><p>Together they returned to Vesāli, where lived Sabbakāmī, the oldest Thera of the day. After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed of four from the East: Sabbakāmī, Sāḷha, Khujjasobhita, and Vāsabhagāmika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambhūta-Sānavāsī, Yasa and Sumana. They debated the question at the Vālikārāma, Revata acting as questioner and Sabbakāmī answering his questions. At the end of the enquiry the decision was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was conveyed to the assembly. Then the recital of the Vinaya was held in which seven hundred monks participated; this recital was called the Sattasatī. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/brahmali#1.1.1'>Vin.ii.294<em>ff.</em></a></p></dd><dt><dfn id='Yasa3'>Yasa</dfn><sup>3</sup></dt><dd><p>A deva, present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#11.9'>DN.ii.259</a> Perhaps the name is Yasasā.</p></dd></dl>"

Taking his admonition to heart, they returned to the banks of the Vaggumuṇḍā in the Vajji country, and there they determined to lead such lives as would commend them to the Buddha. During the rainy season, they all put forth effort and attained arahantship. Some time after, the Buddha visited Vesāli during a journey and asked Ānanda to send for Yasoja and his friends as he desired to see them. Ānanda sent a message.

Having already finished eating, when invited to enter the house, he would not do so, but on the next day he went again, and his father tried to tempt him by making a display of the immense wealth which would be his should he return to the lay life, while his former wives, beautifully clothed, asked him about the nymphs, for whose sake he led the homeless life. “For the sake of no nymphs, Sisters,” he said, and they fell fainting under the shock of being addressed as “Sisters.” Growing impatient at the conduct of his family, he asked for his meal, ate it, preached to them. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn11/en/sujato#2.1'>MN.i.64<em>f.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag16.4/en/sujato#1.1'>Thag.769–775</a> on the impermanence of all things, the futility of wealth, the snare of beauty, etc., and returned to Migacīra.</p><p>There the Kuru king, who was feasting there, and had often heard of Raṭṭhapāla’s fame, visited him.

It is said <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn116/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.iii.68</a> that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vaṅkaka for Vepulla. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn15.20/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.ii.191</a> The Saṁyutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn10.1/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.206</a> mentions another peak near Rājagaha—Indakūta.</p><p>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work. He visited it soon after the Renunciation. Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, and questioned him as to his purpose. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.4/en/sujato#24.1'>Snp verse 472–491</a> During the first year after the Enlightenment the Buddha went to Rājagaha from Gayā, after the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas. Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters, Sakka led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#21.4.3'>Vin.i.35<em>ff.</em></a> Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those ordained were the Sattarasavaggiyā with Upāli at their head.</p><p>The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to Dakkhiṇāgiri and then to Kapilavatthu. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#48.2.1'>Vin.i.77<em>ff.</em></a></p><p>Later the Buddha made Sāvatthī his headquarters, though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha. It thus became the scene of several important suttas—e.g., the Āṭānāṭiya, Udumbarika and Kassapasīhanāda, Jīvaka, Mahāsakuladāyī, and Sakkapañha.</p><p>Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha. Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, Vassakāra, to the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa, to find out what his chances of success were. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.1.1'>DN.ii.72</a></p><p>After the Buddha’s death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with Mahā Kassapa at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at the Sattapaṇṇiguhā, and Ajātasattu extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/brahmali#1.1.27'>Vin.ii.285</a> The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#6.25.1'>DN.ii.166</a></p><p>Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it.

They were a martial people and fond of “sport,” but we find one of their Elders, Mahānāma complaining <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.58/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.iii.76</a> of them to the Buddha— “The Licchavi youths are quick tempered, rough and greedy fellows; such presents as are sent by the members of their tribe sugar cane, jujubes, sweet cakes, sweetmeats, etc. they loot and eat; they slap the women and girls of their tribe on the back.” Violation of chastity was considered a serious offence among the Licchavis, and the assembly would even give its consent to a husband’s request that his unfaithful wife should be murdered. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1/en/brahmali#2.1.17'>Vin.iv.225</a></p><p>According to the Buddhist books, the Licchavis were devout followers of the Buddha and held him in the highest esteem. Five hundred Licchavis once gave a garment each to Piṅgiyāni, because he recited a verse in praise of the Buddha. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.194/en/sujato#12.1'>AN.iii.239</a> Even careless boys, referred to above as wandering about with hounds and bows and arrows, would lay aside their arms when they saw the Buddha seated under a tree and would surround him with clasped hands, eager to hear him. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.58/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.iii.76</a> There were numerous shrines in Vesāli itself, several of which are mentioned by name: Cāpāla, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, Gotama, Sārandada and Udena. It is, however, apparent from the Buddhist books themselves that Vesāli was also a stronghold of the Jains. The Buddha visited Vesāli at least three times, and is frequently mentioned as staying in Kūṭāgārasālā in Mahāvana. There the Licchavis visited him in large numbers, sometimes <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.71/en/sujato#12.1'>AN.v.133<em>f.</em></a> disturbing the calm of the spot and obliging resident monks to seek peace in Gosiṅgasālavana near by. Once, five hundred Licchavis invited the Buddha to a discussion held by them at the Sārandada-cetiya regarding the five kinds of treasures. The Buddha went and gave his opinion. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.142/en/sujato#8.1'>AN.iii.167<em>f.</em></a></p><p>But not all the Licchavis were followers of the Buddha. When Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha visited the Buddha at Mahāvana, he was accompanied by five hundred Licchavis, who did not all salute the Buddha as their teacher, but showed him only such respect as was due to an honoured stranger. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#5.1'>MN.i.229</a> Several eminent Licchavis are specially mentioned by name as having visited and consulted the Buddha; among whom are Mahānāma, Sīha, Bhaddiya, Sāḷha, Abhaya, Panditakumāra, Nandaka, Mahāli and Ugga. Several Licchavis, both men and women, joined the Order—e.g., the famous courtesan Ambapālī, Jentī, Sīha and Vāsitthī, and, among monks, Añjanavaniya, Vajjiputta and Sambhūta.</p><p>The Licchavis were greatly admired for their system of government. It was a republic (<i>gaṇa</i>, <i>saṅghā</i>), all the leading members of which were called <i>rājā</i>. They held full and frequent assemblies at which problems affecting either the whole republic or individual members were fully discussed. The Buddha enjoins on the monks the observance of the same habits as practised by the Licchavis. These are given at. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.5.5'>DN.ii.76<em>f.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#28.3.1'>Vin.i.56</a></p><p>In their political relationships with their neighbours, the Licchavis seem to have been on friendly terms with Bimbisāra, king of Māgadha, and with Pasenadi, king of Kosala. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn86/en/sujato#9.1'>MN.ii.101</a></p><p>After the death of Bimbisāra, Ajātasattu, in his desire for the expansion of Māgadha, resolved to destroy the Licchavis.

Several conversations he had with the Buddha are mentioned in the books. For details see the Tevijja Vacchagotta-, Aggi Vacchagotta-, Mahā Vacchagotta-, Vaccha—and Vacchagotta-Suttas. The Saṁyutta Nikāya contains a whole section on Vacchagotta; his discussions were chiefly concerned with such mythical questions as to whether the world is eternal, the nature of life, the existence or otherwise of the Tathāgata after death, etc. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn32.56/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iii.257<em>ff.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn44.6/en/sujato#6.1'>SN.iv.391<em>ff.</em></a> The three Vacchagotta Suttas of the Majjhima Nikāya seem to contain the story of Vacchagotta’s conversion, in due order: at the conclusion of the Tevijja Vacchagotta it is merely stated that “the Paribbājaka Vacchagotta rejoiced in what the Blessed One has said.” At the end of the next, the Aggi Vacchagotta, he is mentioned as having accepted the Buddha as his teacher. In the third, the Mahā Vacchagotta, he seeks ordination from the Buddha at Rājagaha, and receives it after the requisite probationary period of four months. He returns to the Buddha after two weeks and tells him that he has attained all that is to be attained by a non arahant’s understanding and asks for a further exposition of the Doctrine. The Buddha tells him to proceed to the study of calm and insight, whereby sixfold <i>abhiññā</i> may be acquired. Vacchagotta profits by the lesson and soon after becomes an arahant. He thereupon sends news of his attainment to the Buddha through some monks, and the Buddha says he has already heard the news from the devas. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn73/en/sujato#13.17'>MN.i.493–497</a></p><p>This story definitely identifies the Paribbājaka with the Thera of the same name, whose verse of ecstasy is included in the Theragāthā. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag1.112/en/sujato#1.1'>Thag.112</a></p><p>Vacchagotta was a native of Rājagaha, but seems to have travelled widely, for we find him visiting the Buddha at Vesāli, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn70/en/sujato#25.1'>MN.i.481</a> at Sāvatthī, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn71/en/sujato#10.1'>MN.i.483</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn32.56/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iii.257</a> and at Ñātikā, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn44.10/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.iv.401</a> in addition to his visits to Rājagaha. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn72/en/sujato#21.1'>MN.i.489</a></p><p>in the Aṅguttara Nikāya <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.62/en/sujato#10.1'>AN.i.180<em>f.</em></a> a Vacchagotta who is a wanderer visits the Buddha at Venāgapura, where he was at the head of the brahmins.

They spoke of the Buddha as a teacher of a discipline which he himself did not follow, a nihilist. Vajjiyamāhita refuted their arguments, maintaining that the Buddha declared what was good and what was bad, and that the truth of his teachings could be proved. Having thus silenced them, he sought the Buddha, to whom he repeated the conversation. The Buddha praised him, and said it was untrue that he discouraged all austerity and asceticism; such penances as led to the destruction of evil states and the promotion of good states, he welcomed and encouraged.

The Buddha said that as long as the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of prosperity which he had taught them at Sārandada cetiya, they would prosper rather than decline.</p><p>In the Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn108/en/sujato#4.1'>MN.iii.8<em>ff.</em></a> Vassakāra is represented as arriving in the middle of a conversation, which Gopaka Moggallāna was holding with Ānanda, having been sent to inspect the works at Rājagaha, which were in charge of Moggallāna. Having asked the subject of conversation, he inquired whether the Buddha himself or the Order had chosen a leader for the Saṅgha after the Buddha’s death. Ānanda explains that the Buddha did not do so, that no special leader has been appointed, but that there were monks to whom they showed honour and reverence because of their virtue and insight. Vassakāra admits this as good, as does also Upananda, the Senāpati, who is present. Vassakāra asks Ānanda where he lives, and is told, in Veḷuvana. Vassakāra thinks this a good place for the practice of <i>jhāna</i>, and tells Ānanda of a conversation he once had with the Buddha regarding <i>jhāna</i>. Ānanda, remarks that all <i>jhānas</i> are not equally praiseworthy, and Vassakāra takes his leave.</p><p>Three conversations between the Buddha and Vassakāra are recorded in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, all three taking place at Veḷuvana.</p><p>On discovering that a certain forest official had given tribute to Dhaniya without the king’s special leave, he reported the man to the king and had him punished. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#1.1.15'>Vin.iii.42<em>ff.</em></a> In this context we find that Vassakāra was Mahāmatta to Bimbisāra as well.</p></dd></dl>"

Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Naḷerupucimanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tathāgata were so to honour anyone, that person’s head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the Buddha’s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there.</p><p>At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttarāpatha, staying at Verañjā, supplied the monks with food. Moggallāna proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this stay Sāriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them—Vipassī, Sikhī and Vesabhū—did not.</p><p>At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality. Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in the house.</p><p>He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha and a pair to each of the monks.</p><p>After leaving Verañjā the Buddha went to Benares, passing through Soreyya, Saṅkassa and Kaṇṇakujja, and crossing the Ganges at Payāgapatiṭṭhāna. From Benares he proceeded to Vesāli. This account, of the Buddha’s visit to Verañjā, forms the introduction to the Vinaya. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#1.1.1'>Vin.iii.1–11</a> The interview with Verañja is given in the Aṅguttara. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.10/en/sujato#7.1'>AN.iv.172<em>ff.</em></a></p><p>A road led from Verañjā to Madhurā, and the Aṅguttara Nikāya <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.52/en/sujato#4.1'>AN.ii.57<em>f.</em></a> contains a sermon preached by the Buddha to a large number of people while he rested by the roadside.

The next time Udāyī came, she approached him after the meal with all humility and asked him what, according to the arahants, was the cause of weal and woe. “The existence of the senses,” answered Udāyī; and she, expressing her satisfaction, declared herself a follower of Udāyī. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.132/en/sujato#14.1'>SN.iv.121<em>f.</em></a></p></dd></dl>"

On such occasions, the Four Regent Devas are present in the assembly with their followers of the Cātummahārājika world.<a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#10.11'>DN.ii.207<em>f.</em></a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#1.1'>DN.ii.220<em>f.</em></a> Among the Tāvatiṁsā devas, Sakka surpasses his companions in ten things: length of life, beauty, happiness, renown, power; and in the degree of his five sense experiences: sight, hearing, smelling, taste and touch. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.36/en/sujato#4.1'>AN.iv.242</a></p><p>In the Saṁyutta Nikāya <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.10/en/sujato#6.1'>SN.i.228</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.12/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.229</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.13/en/sujato#12.1'>SN.i.231</a> the Buddha gives seven rules of conduct, which rules Sakka carried out as a human being, thus attaining to his celestial sovereignty. When the devas fight the Asuras they do so under the banner and orders of Sakka.</p><p>In the Saṁyutta Nikāya a whole Saṁyutta—one of the shortest, consisting of twenty five short suttas—is devoted to Sakka.</p><p>Sakka was considered by the early Buddhists as a god of high character, kindly and just, but not perfect, and not very intelligent. His imperfections are numerous: in spite of his very great age, he is still subject to death and rebirth <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.37/en/sujato#5.1'>AN.i.144</a> ; as an example of this, it is mentioned that Sunetta had thirty five times been reborn as Sakka, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.66/en/sujato#13.1'>AN.iv.105</a> a statement confirmed by the Buddha. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.62/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iv.89</a></p><p>In the Sakkapañha Sutta, Sakka is said to have visited the Buddha at Vediyagiri in Ambasaṇḍā and to have asked him a series of questions. He sends Pañcasikha with his vinā to play and sing to the Buddha and to obtain permission for him to visit him and question him.</p><p>The Buddha says to himself that Sakka, for a long time past, has led a pure life, and gives him permission to question him on any subject. It is stated in the course of the sutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.9.1'>DN.ii.270</a> that it was not the first time that Sakka had approached the Buddha for the same purpose. He had gone to him at the Salaghara in Sāvatthī, but found him in meditation, with Bhuñjatī, wife of Vessavaṇa, waiting on him. He therefore left with a request to Bhuñjatī to greet the Buddha in his name. He also declares <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#2.8.7'>DN.ii.286</a> that he has become a sotāpanna and has earned for himself the right to be reborn eventually in the Akaniṭṭhā world, whence he will pass entirely away. Sakka admits <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#2.7.5'>DN.ii.284</a> that he visited other brahmins and recluses as well. They were pleased to see him, and boasted that they had nothing to teach him; but he had to teach them what he knew.</p><p>An account of another interview which Sakka had with the Buddha is given in the Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta. There the question arises regarding the extirpation of cravings. Sakka accepts the Buddha’s answer and leaves him. Anxious to discover whether Sakka has understood the Buddha’s teaching, Moggallāna visits Sakka and questions him. Sakka evades the questions and shows Moggallāna the glories of his Vejayanta palace. Moggallāna then frightens him by a display of <i>iddhi</i>-power, and Sakka repeats to him, word for word, the Buddha’s answer. Moggallāna departs satisfied, and Sakka tells his handmaidens that Moggallāna is a “fellow of his” in the higher life, meaning, probably, that he himself is a sotāpanna and therefore a kinsman of the arahant.</p><p>In a passage in the Saṁyutta. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn9.7/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.201</a> Sakka is represented as descending from heaven to make an enquiry about Nibbāna, and in another <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn40.9/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iv.269<em>f.</em></a> as listening, in heaven, to Moggallāna’s exposition of the simplest duties of a good layman. On another occasion, at Vessavaṇa’s suggestion, Sakka visited Uttara Thera on the Sankheyyaka Mountain and listened to a sermon by him. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.8/en/sujato#3.1'>AN.iv.163<em>f.</em></a></p></dd></dl>"

There was suddenly a vast radiance, and the devas knew of the approach of Sanaṅkumāra. As the usual appearance of the Brahmā is not sufficiently materialized for him to be perceived by the Devas of Tāvatiṁsā, he is forced to appear as a relatively gross personality which he specially creates. As he arrives, the Devas sit in their places with clasped hands waiting for him to choose his seat. Then Sanaṅkumāra takes on the form of Pañcasikha and sits, above the assembly, cross legged, in the air. So seated, he expresses his satisfaction that Sakka and all the Tāvatiṁsā Devas should honour and follow the Buddha. His voice has all the eight characteristics of a Brahmā’s voice. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#17.9'>DN.ii.211</a> He then proceeds to create thirty three shaper, of himself, each sitting on the divan of a Tāvatiṁsā Deva, and addresses the Devas, speaking of the advantages of taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha. Each deva fancies that only the shape sitting on his own divan has spoken and that the others are silent. Then Sanaṅkumāra goes to the end of the Hall, and, seated on Sakka’s throne, addresses the whole assembly on the four ways of <i>iddhi</i>; on the three avenues leading to Bliss, as manifested by the Buddha; on the four <i>satipaṭṭhānas</i>, and the seven <i>samādhiparikkhārā</i>. He declares that more than twenty four lakhs of Māgadha disciples, having followed the teachings of the Buddha, have been born in the deva worlds. When Sanaṅkumāra has finished his address, Vessavaṇa wonders if there have been Buddhas in the past and will be in the future.

But in the end Sīha, accompanied by five hundred chariots, went to the Buddha. Having discovered in conversation with the Buddha that he was falsely accused of preaching wrong doctrines, Sīha declared himself the Buddha’s follower. The Buddha accepted his adherence on condition that he would continue to give alms to any Nigaṇṭhas who sought them at his house. This generosity made Sīha honour the Buddha even more highly, and he invited him and the monks to a meal on the next day. Meat formed one of the dishes, and the Nigaṇṭhas went about Vesāli crying that Sīha had killed a large ox to provide meat for the Buddha and his monks and that the food had been accepted.

When he went to his father’s house, in Kalandakagāma, he saw a servant girl about to throw away some boiled rice and asked her to put it into his bowl. The girl, recognizing his hands and feet and voice, told his mother of his arrival. Both she and his father visited him as he was eating the rice, and his father took him by the hand and led him home. There he was provided with a seat and asked to eat: but he refused, saying he had already eaten. The next day he was again invited; he went, and they tried to tempt him back to the lay life. His former wife joined in the attempt, but on being addressed by him as “Sister,” she fell fainting. Then he begged for his meal, saying that if they desired to give it to him they should do so without worrying him. Later his wife visited him, with his mother, at the Mahāvana, and begged that he would give her a son, so that the Licchavis might not confiscate their wealth for want of an heir. Sudinna agreed, and had intercourse three times with her. She became pregnant, and in due course a son was born, who was called Bījaka. When Sudinna realized what he had done he was filled with remorse, and his colleagues, discovering the reason, reported him to the Buddha, who blamed him greatly. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#4.6'>Vin.iii.11–21</a></p></dd></dl>"

The Buddha reminded him that he had not promised to do any of these things, and that, at one time, Sunakkhatta had been loud in his praise of the Buddha and the Dhamma. The Buddha warned him that people would say he had left the Order because its discipline had proved too hard for him. The Buddha had told him that Korakkhattiya, whom he so much admired, would be born after death among the Kālakañjaka Asuras within seven days. It happened as the Buddha prophesied, and the dead body of Kora declared that he was right. But even so, Sunakkhatta was not convinced.</p><p>Later he transferred his allegiance to Kandaramasaka, who died, as the Buddha had prophesied, fallen from grace and fame. The next teacher to win the admiration of Sunakkhatta was Pātikaputta, and Sunakkhatta wished the Buddha to pay honour to him. But the Buddha quoted to Sunakkhatta the words of Ajita, the Licchavi general who had been born in Tāvatiṁsā, to the effect that Pātikaputta was “a liar and a cheat,” and was later able to prove that these words were true. But Sunakkhatta did not return to the Order. He had probably remained in it for several years before actually leaving it. For we find in the Mahāli Sutta <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn6/en/sujato#4.3'>DN.i.152</a> the Licchavi Oṭṭhaddha relating to the Buddha how Sunakkhatta had come to him three years after joining the Order, claiming that he could see divine forms but could not hear heavenly sounds.

He saw the Buddha seated under a tree, his head covered; he approached him with the oblation and a water pitcher and addressed him. The Buddha uncovered his head. The sight of the shaven head at first made Sundarika draw back, but, realizing that some brahmins too were shaved, he questioned the Buddha about his birth. The Buddha explained to him that the important thing was not birth, but the leading of a good life. The brahmin was pleased and offered him the oblation, but the Buddha refused it, saying that he did not accept presents for chanting verses. He advised Sundarika to throw the food into the water, where there were no creatures, for who could digest food which had once been offered to a Buddha? The brahmin followed this advice and saw the water hiss and seethe with steam and smoke.

Even so, energy, when over-strung, ends in flurry, when over-lax, in idleness. Soṇa profits by the lesson and becomes an arahant.

Soṇa then sought the Buddha alone and joined the Order. After ordination he walked about meditating, his feet bled, and his cankamana was covered with blood “like a slaughter house for oxen.” After Soṇa attained arahantship, the Buddha gave him permission to wear shoes with one lining.
